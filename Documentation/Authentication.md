# Authentication

To run the Google Cloud Storageâ„¢ client library, you must first set up authentication by creating a service account and setting an environment variable.
Note: You need to set environment variables before starting a MATLAB instance for the environment variables to be effective.

## Getting Service account key:
1. In the [Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), navigate to the [Create service account key page](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/serviceaccountkey).
2. Select an existing Project or Create a new Project.
3. From the Service account list, select an existing service account or create a new service account.
4. If you have selected a New Service account, key in a name for the Service account name field. 
5. From the Role list, select Project > Owner.(Optional: Cloud Admin manages Roles for users. You will need EDITOR role for writing to cloud storage)

```Click Create. A JSON file that contains your key downloads to your computer.```

## Note:
The Role field authorizes your service account to access resources. If you get permission issues while using the support package within MATLAB, you should look for EDITOR Role access for Service Account within the selected Project.
You can view and change this field later by using the [Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/). If you are developing a production app, specify more granular permissions than ```Project > Owner```. 

For more information, see [granting roles](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-roles-to-service-accounts) to service accounts.

## Providing authentication credentials to your MATLAB application:
1. Place downloaded JSON file at a local directory on your system. e.g.```..\Software\MATLAB\config```
```
{
  "type": "service_account",
  "project_id": "project-123REDACTED45",
  "private_key_id": "1378f5fREDACTED50eb2",
  "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nMIIEvQIBADANBgkqhBZv2fE=\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
  "client_email": "467REDACTED5389-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com",
  "client_id": "115REDACTED7232",
  "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
  "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
  "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
  "client_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/46REDACTED5389-compute%40developer.gserviceaccount.com"
}
```
2. Rename the json file to a more readable format e.g. credentials.json

3. Add Environment Variable GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS:

* UNIX:

```
>> export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=../Software/MATLAB/config/credentials.json;
```

* WINDOWS:

  Navigate to ```Advanced System Settings >> Environment Variables```<sup>1</sup> and add new User variable ```GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS``` with value "/project/location/Software/MATLAB/config/credentials.json"
   
![environment variable](images/Windows_env_var.png)

 Note: This environment variable only applies to your profile. If you need a less persistent way of setting credentials path, you can do so by setting the variables through shell and starting MATLAB from there.

4. To check whether credentials have been set correctly look for environment variable GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS as follows
```
getenv("GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS")

ans =

    '..\matlab-google-cloud-storage\Software\MATLAB\config\credentials.json'
```
  For more information on setting up credentials for Cloud Storage Server applications see: <https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production>

## Usage

Note: Make sure you have followed the steps for [building the SDK](Installation.md) and have run ```/Software/MATLAB/startup.m``` before creating a Storage client.

Creating google-cloud-storage client without explicitly mentioning filepath to credentials. The code will by default look for the environment variable settings.
```
storage = gcp.storage.Storage()
```

You can also explicitly pass in different credentials by passing the filename as the input argument, as follows:
```
storage = gcp.storage.Storage("credentials.json")
```
